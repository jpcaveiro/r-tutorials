# Bookdown {#Bookdown}

```
library(bookdown)
```

## First steps and concepts


* First do `knitr` on `index.Rmd`to create `packages.bib` file.

* [BOOKDOWN](https://bookdown.org/) Write HTML, PDF, ePub, and Kindle books with R Markdown

* [install](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)

```r
install.packages("bookdown")
```

Clone [bookdown-demo.git](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo.git) using git for windows

## bookdown examples





### Introduction 

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].




### Methods

We describe our methods in this chapter.

Math can be added in body using usual syntax like this 

### math example

$p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

$$
SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
$$

You can also use math in footnotes like this^[where we mention $p = \frac{a}{b}$].

We will approximate standard error to 0.027[^longnote]

[^longnote]: $p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

    $$
    SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
    $$




## Developing mode

1. Open <file:///C:/Users/pedrocruz/Documents/GitHub/r-tutorials/_book/index.html> 

    * in Chrome to use "translations" (right button)

2. Knit every file 01, 02, etc. Knit `index.Rmd`.
