# R Markdown


```{r echo=FALSE}
require(datasets)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

*References:*

* [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax):
    * "Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML."

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```



**Plots**

You can also embed plots, for example:



```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the "echo = FALSE" parameter could be added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
