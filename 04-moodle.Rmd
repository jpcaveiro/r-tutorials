## schoice

View example [swisscapital: Knowledge Quiz Question about the Swiss Capital](https://www.r-exams.org/templates/swisscapital/).

*Single Choice* means only one sentence is correct.

    Meta-information
    ================
    exname: Swiss Capital
    extype: schoice
    exsolution: 0100000
    exshuffle: 5

-   `exname: Swiss Capital` (exercise: where `exname` is used?)
-   `extype: schoice` -- Single Choice question type
-   `exsolution: 0100000` -- only second item is correct
-   `exshuffle: 5` -- `exshuffle` is set to 5 so that 1 correct and 4 random wrong alternatives are subsampled and shuffled.

The exercise filename, `swisscapital.Rmd`, is used in moodle xml file to identify the question in **Moodle Category catalog**:

-   `<text> R1 Q2 : swisscapital </text>` (excert from moodle xml file)



*working example*


    # setwd("~/<root of r-exams project>")
    library("exams")
    set.seed(2023-05-16) # or 2002
    exams2html("exercises/swisscapital.Rmd", 
               n = 1, 
               name = "r-exams-tutorial",
               edir="exercises")
       ##omitt parameter  dir="output" to open the browser



    # setwd("~/<root of r-exams project>")
    library("exams")
    set.seed(2023-05-16)
    exams2moodle("exercises/swisscapital.Rmd", 
                 n = 1, 
                 name = "r-exams-tutorial",
                 edir="exercises",
                 dir="output")
      ## This yields the file R-exams.xml that can be imported into Moodle.




## mchoice


*Multiple Choice* one or more correct.

Danger: students will always earn points if turn on/off every option.


View example: [ttest: Interpretation of 2-Sample t Test](https://www.r-exams.org/templates/ttest/)



    Meta-information
    ================
    extype: mchoice
    exsolution:  r mchoice2string(solutions) 
    exname: 2-sample t-test

-   `extype: mchoice` -- Multiple Choice question type
-   `exsolution:  r mchoice2string(solutions)`
-   `exname`: 2-sample t-test (exercise: where `exname` is used?)

Variable `solutions` is a vector like `c(T,T,F,F,T)` indicating which sentences are true. The vector can be explicitly described or calculated.


What does `exams::mchoice2string`?

    > mchoice2string(c(T,T,F,F))
    [1] "1100"



*working example*


    # setwd("~/<root of r-exams project>")
    library("exams")
    set.seed(2023-05-16) # or 2002
    exams2html("exercises/ttest.Rmd", 
               name = "r-exams-tutorial",
               edir="exercises")



    # setwd("~/<root of r-exams project>")
    library("exams")
    set.seed(2023-05-16)
    exams2moodle("exercises/ttest.Rmd", 
                 n = 1, 
                 name = "r-exams-tutorial",
                 edir="exercises",
                 dir="output")
      ## This yields the file R-exams.xml that can be imported into Moodle.



## numerical


The tradicional numeric value input, in Moodle.


View example [deriv: Product Rule for Derivatives](https://www.r-exams.org/templates/deriv/)


    Meta-information
    ================
    extype: num
    exsolution:  r fmt(res) 
    exname: derivative exp
    extol: 0.01

What does `exams::fmt()`? Moodle does not recognize numeric representations like "1e-15":

    library(exams)
    > fmt(1e-15)
    [1] "0.00"





## shortanswer


Exact word: Participant should introduce a word or small sentence to be automatically checked

Small Essays: some exercise authors can use this for participant to introduce small essays but it gives a little of extra work in Moodle!


View example [function: String Question about R Functions](https://www.r-exams.org/assets/posts/2017-08-14-function//function.Rmd)


    Meta-information
    ================
    extype: string
    exsolution:  r fun 
    exname: R functions

In the example, the variable `fun` is a word calculated in code and is the solution.




## cloze (explicit Answerlist)


`cloze` is a question type that combines numerical, schoice, mchoice, shortanswer, true/false.


View example [lm: Simple Linear Regression (with CSV Data)](https://www.r-exams.org/templates/lm/)



The first 3 items are for a `schoice` question and the last item is a numerical question (declared in meta-information).

    Question
    ========
    Using the data provided in [regression.csv](regression.csv) estimate a linear regression of
    `y` on `x` and answer the following questions.

    Answerlist
    ----------
    * `x` and `y` are not significantly correlated
    * `y` increases significantly with `x`
    * `y` decreases significantly with `x`
    * Estimated slope with respect to `x`:


The interpretation of each item is given in `exclozetype`:


    Meta-information
    ================
    exname: Linear regression
    extype: cloze
    exsolution:  r mchoice2string(bsol) | r fmt(bhat, 3) 
    exclozetype: schoice|num
    extol: 0.01


-   `exclozetype: schoice|num` declares question type of items in `Answerlist`
-   `exsolution:  r mchoice2string(bsol) | r fmt(bhat, 3)`
    -   are the solutions. For example, after call to `mchoice2string()` and `fmt()`:
    -   `exsolution: 0100|1.34`



## cloze (calculated Answerlist and "##" marks)

"cloze" question with use of placeholders like `##ANSWER1##` in combination with meta-information.


- [fourfold2: Fourfold Table (Flexible Formatting)](https://www.r-exams.org/templates/fourfold2/)

    Question
    ========
    
    An industry-leading company seeks a qualified candidate for a management position.
    A management consultancy carries out an assessment center which concludes in making
    a positive or negative recommendation for each candidate: From previous assessments they know that
    of those candidates that are actually eligible for the position (event $E$) $r per * 100\%$
    get a positive recommendation (event $R$). However, out of those candidates that are not eligible
    $r pnenr * 100\%$ get a negative recommendation. Overall, they know that only
    $r pe * 100\%$ of all job applicants are actually eligible.
    
    What is the corresponding fourfold table of the joint probabilities? (Specify all entries in percent.)
    
    |               | $R$           | $\overline{R}$ | sum           |
    |:-------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
    |$E$            | ##ANSWER1##\% | ##ANSWER3##\%  | ##ANSWER7##\% |
    |$\overline{E}$ | ##ANSWER2##\% | ##ANSWER4##\%  | ##ANSWER8##\% |
    |sum            | ##ANSWER5##\% | ##ANSWER6##\%  | ##ANSWER9##\% |
    
    ```
    #line up =>{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
    answerlist(rep("", length(sol)), markup = "markdown")
    ```

What is `answerlist(...)`? It returns markdown text has if the author types several `*`-items:


    > questions <- list(a="aaa", b="bbb")
    > answerlist(unlist(questions), markup = "markdown")
    Answerlist
    ----------
    * aaa
    * bbb

    

In meta-information `exclozetype` has 9 numerical declarations:


    Meta-information
    ================
    extype: cloze
    exsolution:  r paste(sol, collapse = "|") 
    exclozetype: num|num|num|num|num|num|num|num|num
    exname: fourfold
    extol: 0.05
    exextra[numwidth,logical]: TRUE


-   `exsolution:  r paste(sol, collapse = "|")` could produce something like "100.3\|20.45...."
-   `exextra[numwidth,logical]: TRUE` -- (to be found in literature!)

- In `exams2moodle()` we support a couple of Moodle-specific `exextra` options, namely some detailed formatting of "essay" type questions. All supported options can be found in the "essayreg" exercise template.
- Additionally, it's possible to set the `numwidth` and `stringwidth` arguments from `exams2moodle()` also via `exextra` options. See the "fourfold2" exercise template for a worked example.

## special moodle instructions

Instead of setting `exshuffle` to TRUE (or a number) which does the shuffling on the R side, it is also possible to do the shuffling in Moodle by selecting a `cloze_mchoice_display` that includes shuffling, e.g., `MULTICHOICE_S` or `MULTICHOICE_VS` etc.


        exams2moodle(questions,
                 name = "exameXPTO", 
                 cloze = list(cloze_mchoice_display = "MULTICHOICE_VS"), 
                 envir =.GlobalEnv)

where

- `cloze = list(cloze_mchoice_display = "MULTICHOICE_VS")` -- choosen moodle instruction
- `envir =.GlobalEnv` -- use context variables (used in the Question) stored in user's workspace ("The global environment .GlobalEnv, more often known as the user's workspace, is the first item on the search path")

## restrictions in moodle "cloze"

The **essays** or **file uploads** are not currently supported in Moodle **cloze type** exercises!

View example [essayreg2.Rmd](https://www.r-exams.org/templates/essayreg2/)

Moodle does not handle when Meta-information combines other types with "essay" or "file" types as case of:


    Meta-information
    ================
    exname: Linear regression
    extype: cloze
    exsolution: OLS|01001| r fmt(ahat, 3) | r fmt(bhat, 3) | r mchoice2string(bsol |nil|nil
    exclozetype: string|mchoice|num|num|schoice|essay|file
    extol: 0.01


Warnings for Moodle:

-   note `essay|file` in meta-information.

However, R-exams can also output for PDF, HTML and OLAT formats with this question types.



Instruction `exams2html()` works but not `exams2moodle()`:
    
    > library(exams)
    > setwd("where exercises are")
    > exams2html("essayreg.Rmd")
    > exams2moodle("essayreg.Rmd")
    Error in moodlequestion[[type]](exm[[i]][[j]]) : 
      essays or file uploads are not currently supported in Moodle cloze type exercises!




## essay/file question type in Moodle


They share the same code in Moodle. 

- this section need work! Only file question is working.

Warning: in r-exams the `extype: string` should be declared in meta-information (there is no "extype: file" or "extype: essay"!)

*Reference*. [essayreg.Rmd](https://www.r-exams.org/templates/essayreg/)


### essay question


*Example of an essay*. Do you think the assumptions of the Gauss-Markov theorem are fulfilled? What are the consequences?

- In `exams2moodle()` we support a couple of Moodle-specific `exextra` options, namely some detailed formatting of "essay" type questions. All supported options can be found in the `essayreg` exercise template.
- An essay, in Word, can also be uploaded using file question type.



### file question


*Example of file request*. Please upload your code script that reads the data, fits the regression model, extracts the quantities of interest, and generates the diagnostic plots.



### both file and essay


*Example of an essay and file in same moodle question*. 

- Do you think the assumptions of the Gauss-Markov theorem are fulfilled? What are the consequences?
- Please upload your code script that reads the data, fits the regression model, extracts the quantities of interest, and generates the diagnostic plots
